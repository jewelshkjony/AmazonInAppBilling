# AmazonInAppBilling Extension
An in-app-billing extension to monetize your app products using Amazon store billing library 3.0.3.

The In-App Purchasing (IAP) API allows your app to present, process, and fulfill purchases of digital content and subscriptions within your app. Amazon supports an IAP API for Android Apps.

# Configure Appstore SDK with your public key
This public key, which is unique per app, establishes a secure communication channel between the Amazon Appstore and your app. When you generate the public key from the Developer Console, Amazon generates a corresponding private key. These public and private keys form a key pair to sign license responses. Through this key pairing, you ensure that the users who install your app are authorized.

To configure your existing app with the public key:

1. Log into the [Developer Console](https://developer.amazon.com/) with your developer account.

2. Go to **Apps & Services > My Apps** . Then click your app. (If you don't already have an app, see [Log In and Add an App](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/app-submission/publish-app-login-and-add-app.html).)

3. Create a new version of your app. In the area below your app's name, click **Upcoming Version** .

:warning: **Important:** The link to the public key appears only when you create a new version or when you create a new app. 
If you had a new version in progress prior to the release of the Appstore SDK, 
you must complete your existing version and then create a new version. 
Only then does the public key link appear. 
(Alternatively, submit a [Contact Us Case](https://developer.amazon.com/support/contact-us) regarding your app and request that the Upcoming Version be cancelled.)

4. Go to the [App Information](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/app-submission/app-information.html) tab.

5. Click **Public Key** in the upper-right area.

6. In the Public Key dialog box that appears, click the **AppstoreAuthenticationKey.pem** link to download a PEM file. This file contains your public key.

7. Copy the **AppstoreAuthenticationKey.pem** file. Then paste it into the **assets** folder of your builder.

:information_source: **Note:** If you integrate your app with Login with Amazon (LwA) or Amazon Device Messaging (ADM), you need to add your app's API Keys. Appstore SDK integrated apps do not add API Keys automatically. You need to manage the API Key and see [LwA](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/login-with-amazon/register-android.html#add-android-settings) and [ADM](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/adm/obtain-credentials.html) documentation for more details. You can find your AppStore certificate hash values in the Developer Console to create the API keys for the existing apps. Go to **My apps** > select your app > **App Information** > **Appstore Certificate Hashes** .
